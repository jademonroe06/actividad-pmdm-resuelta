Since Android Studio 2.2 and up to 3.0, new projects are created with this gitignore file:

*.iml
.gradle
/local.properties
/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/libraries
.DS_Store
/build
/captures
.externalNativeBuild
Deprecated - for older project format, add this section to your gitignore file:


/*/out
/*/*/build
/*/*/production
*.iws
*.ipr
*~
*.swp
This file should be located in the project's root folder and not inside the project's module folder.

Edit Notes:

Since version 0.3+ it seems you can commit and push *.iml and build.gradle files. If your project is based on Gradle: in the new open/import dialog, you should check the "use auto import" checkbox and mark the "use default gradle wrapper (recommended)" radio button. All paths are now relative as @George suggested.

Updated answer according to @128KB attached source and @Skela suggestions

Why do we have to import the project and manually add libs and module dependencies? Is there any way to preserve those things in the repo and when we clone the repo just do a project open?

The proper way to do this is to check in the *.iml and *.ipr files, and just open them in the IDE. Why force other people on your team to recreate these files, and why allow them to use possibly incorrect settings (such as sdk version)?

@liorry , I disagree. This is the first answer other people will see, and it is massively up-voted. Due to all the things you need to do to get a project up and running after a fresh clone from git using this particular .gitignore I strongly feel this is not what most people would need. Although I guess the number of up-votes tells me otherwise, but I still don't agree. At the very least, perhaps some information stating that you most likely will have to set the project up again and it won't work out-of-the-box.

@liorry, I don't mean to be rude or anything mate, please don't take it personally. The issue is, these things need to work with minimal amount of setup to be of any practical use. When you need to Import the project, and manually add module dependancies its immediately entered a realm of lunacy. When you are familiar with a project, and know these things inside-out, then there is no issue with your approach. But for a developer who is cloning the project for the first time, its just not that practical. I really am just trying to make sure that your approach does not become the norm thats all.

You should not version the .iml files unless you wan't to deal with unneeded annoyances if other users name the project differently when they check out.

Building on my normal Android .gitignore, and after reading through documentation on the Intellij IDEA website and reading posts on StackOverflow, I have constructed the following file:

# built application files
*.apk
*.ap_

# files for the dex VM
*.dex

# Java class files
*.class

# built native files (uncomment if you build your own)
# *.o
# *.so

# generated files
bin/
gen/

# Ignore gradle files
.gradle/
build/

# Local configuration file (sdk path, etc)
local.properties

# Proguard folder generated by Eclipse
proguard/

# Eclipse Metadata
.metadata/

# Mac OS X clutter
*.DS_Store

# Windows clutter
Thumbs.db

# Intellij IDEA (see https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/23393067)
.idea/workspace.xml
.idea/tasks.xml
.idea/datasources.xml
.idea/dataSources.ids
